# lineFollower_ArduinoWeimos

to facilitate the construction and programming of a line following robot, I made this web app that allows to print the values of the infrared sensors via Http requests, in real time using an arduino equipped with a wifi module.

here you'll find the interface as well as the server.

## Setup 

`cd front` and run `npm install` then `cd api` and run `npm install`
